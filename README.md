# Discord Group Leaver

Saw some guy charging $30 for people who got group spammed (added to thousands of groups) to crash their Discord, so I made this to help those people out for free. Simply just use Python 3.8 or higher and run it, it will ask for your token which I assume you know how to retrieve.

This can be used to leave all groups chats or ones with a specific name, which in most cases for the group chat spammers - they have a static name for each group chat.
